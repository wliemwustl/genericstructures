# Generic Structures
## Models to reuse and repurpose so you don't have to start from scratch.

This repository contains commonly used structures used in system dynamics modeling. These models can be a useful place to start modeling
by identifying key heuristics across common problems. For example, a bass diffusion model was primarily created to help think understand
how people become interested and start adopting new products. We can add a "re-adoption" structure to the bass diffusion structure to model problems around infectious diseases through SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) models.

Generic structures are a great place to start with any modeling project.
